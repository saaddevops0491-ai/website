The radiation emitted from gamma sources is uncontrollable and, upon exposure, can cause irreversible damage to living cells. Due to these hazards, gamma sources are subject to stringent regulations throughout their lifecycle—from procurement to disposal. Consequently, the total cost of ownership of gamma-based MPFMs is estimated to be at least 40% higher than that of non-gamma alternatives."

Key obstacles include non-linear and non-monotonic dielectric responses measured by both low-frequency (capacitance and conductance) and high-frequency (microwave) sensors. Additionally, IR spectroscopy is an intrusive sensing method, while ultrasonic techniques suffer from extreme signal dispersion in multiphase (liquid/gas) conditions."

Instead, we employ a patented microwave DMOR design to measure the dielectric properties of multiphase mixtures at microwave frequencies. To address the challenge of non-linear and non-monotonic inverse measurements, Saher has developed a proprietary digital twin AI model that predicts complex multiphase behavior. This AI-driven model trains Saher's flow computer with minimal reliance on flow-loop calibration and is fully parametrized for water-liquid ratio (WLR), gas volume fraction (GVF), brine salinity, fluid temperature, and pressure. By integrating raw dielectric measurements with the insights from the digital twin AI, Saher's MPFM delivers highly reliable, real-time multiphase measurements."
