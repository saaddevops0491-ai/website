**Saher Flow Solutions**, a cutting-edge advanced sensing solution provider based in Saudi Arabia, has been highlighted in the first edition of LEAP magazine. The company, known for its innovative water-cut and multiphase flow meters, is making waves in the oil and gas industry by helping companies manage unwanted produced water, thereby reducing their costs per barrel.

## Visionary Leadership

Founded by **Prof. Atif Shamim**, a distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saher Flow Solutions has a clear mission: to introduce sustainability-focused technologies to the oil and gas sector.

> "We are the first deep tech startup to ever produce artificial intelligence-enabled multiphase flow metering solutions to help optimize upstream oil and gas production processes," says Prof. Shamim.

## Regional Market Leadership

As the **only provider of multiphase flow metering technology** in the entire GCC region, Saher Flow Solutions aims to democratize this industry within the next three to five years.

### Economic Impact Projections

The company's efforts could deliver significant regional benefits:

- 💰 **US$500 million** savings in imports for GCC states
- 👥 **200+ direct job opportunities** creation
- 🏭 **Technology democratization** across the region

## Operating in Saudi Arabia's Tech Ecosystem

Operating a deep tech enterprise in Saudi Arabia has presented both challenges and rewards, according to Prof. Shamim.

### Opportunities

> "In line with Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia has completely revamped its venture capital infrastructure, offering some of the highest levels of investment opportunities for startups," he notes.

### Challenges

However, he also points out that tech startups like Saher Flow Solutions still rely on specialized materials and equipment from outside the Kingdom, which can impact product development.

Prof. Shamim expresses optimism that the Kingdom's tech infrastructure will continue to strengthen, further supporting the growth of innovative companies like his.

## Advice for Deep Tech Startups

For other deep tech startups considering Saudi Arabia as a base for operations, Prof. Shamim advises:

### 🚀 **Start with Incubators**
"Begin their journey at one of the many technology incubators available in the Kingdom. These incubators offer guidance, support, and a great launch pad."

### 🎯 **Focus on MVP**
"From there, finding a niche and delivering a minimum viable product to the market should be the next immediate focus. This approach will help gain investor confidence and open up avenues for further expansion."

## Continuing Innovation

Saher Flow Solutions continues to lead the way in revolutionizing the oil and gas industry with its pioneering technologies, driving both economic growth and sustainability in the region.
