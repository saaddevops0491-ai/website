**Saher Flow Solutions participates in IKTVA forum 2023** as kingdom's **first and only supplier of multiphase flow meters (MPFMs)**.

## Supporting Vision 2030

**IKTVA (In Kingdom Total Value Addition)** is Aramco's flagship program to promote local content in products and services utilized inside Saudi Aramco. The target is to achieve **70% localization** of products and services by 2030.

## Perfectly Positioned for Localization

Saher Flow Solutions is perfectly positioned as kingdom's first and only company which not only **manufactures MPFM inside the kingdom** but also **designs each and every part** in the premises of Saudi Arabia.

### Strategic Technology Development

The technology has been **co-developed by Saudi Aramco itself** in collaboration with **King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)**. Saher Flow Solutions holds the **exclusive license to commercialize** this strategically significant technology to meet the needs of Saudi Aramco.

## Addressing Industry Challenges

**Aramco is the world's biggest user of multiphase flow meters** and has field tested almost all kinds of MPFM technologies ranging from:

- 🔊 **Ultrasonics**
- ☢️ **Gamma rays**
- 🌡️ **Far infrared waves**

### Existing Technology Limitations

All existing technologies have reported several challenges:

- ❌ **Measurement inaccuracy**
- ⚠️ **HSE hazard** due to radioactive gamma ray sources
- 🔧 **Intrusive measurements** requiring contact with multiphase mixture

## Revolutionary Microwave DMOR Technology

With **9 years of R&D**, Saudi Aramco has developed **microwave DMOR technology** which offers:

### Key Advantages

- ✅ **High accuracy** owing to integrated digital twin model
- 🛡️ **Safe to use** - no hazardous gamma ray source required
- 🎯 **Accurate measurements** over full range of WLR and GVF
- 🤖 **AI-enabled digital twin model** for enhanced precision

### Orientation Flexibility

This technology gives accurate measurements in a **wide range of flow regimes**, which is why it can be installed in **any orientation**:

- ↔️ **Horizontal**
- ↕️ **Vertical** 
- ↗️ **Any angle in between**

The **orientation insensitivity** is extremely helpful for the extension of this technology for **full-range downhole water-cut measurements**.

## Global Field Testing

This technology is now **fully commercialized** and is being field tested in various parts of:

- 🏜️ **GCC region**
- 🌎 **South America**
- 🌏 **Far East Asia**
