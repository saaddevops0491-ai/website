**Saher is a technology company** specializing in three-phase water-cut and multiphase flow metering solutions. Our innovative technology is being validated by a growing number of energy companies worldwide, underscoring its reliability and effectiveness.

## Historic GCC Milestone

Notably, we are the **first company in the GCC** to have developed multiphase metering technology entirely within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This distinction has made Saudi Aramco a particularly valued partner for Saher.

Recently, we achieved a **historic milestone**: obtaining pre-qualification approval from Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil and gas company.

## Rigorous Testing at DNV

This approval followed **rigorous blind flow loop trials** conducted at DNV's state-of-the-art, third-party test facility in the Netherlands.

### Testing Protocol

During these trials, conducted in collaboration with Saudi Aramco and DNV, Saher's multiphase meter was tested with various combinations of:

- **Oil flow rates**
- **Water flow rates** 
- **Gas flow rates**

### Technical Specifications

Adhering to Saudi Aramco's stringent engineering procedure, the meter's performance was compared to highly accurate reference measurements from DNV's flow loop.

**Test Conditions:**
- **Fluids**: Natural gas, synthetic oil (D-120), and brine
- **Pressure**: 500 psi controlled environment
- **Duration**: Five days of comprehensive testing
- **Analysis**: Detailed data analytics considering reference equipment measurement uncertainties

## Outstanding Results

The results demonstrated that **Saher's multiphase meter performed within specifications** in both:
- ✅ **Oil-continuous flow regions**
- ✅ **Water-continuous flow regions**

This validation confirms our technology's reliability across the full spectrum of multiphase flow conditions encountered in real-world operations.
