**Multiphase flow metering** has revolutionized well-testing operations by providing **24/7 access to production data**, leading to production optimization and operational efficiency.

## The Challenge with Traditional Methods

### Radioactive Limitations
**Gamma rays** have been essential components of MPFMs for more than **3 decades**. However, multiple downsides exist:

- **Health hazards** requiring strict safety rules
- **Extensive certifications** and compliance requirements
- **Steep maintenance costs** through authorized safety officers
- **Import restrictions** and regulatory complexities

### Non-Radioactive Challenges
Existing non-radioactive MPFMs face unique challenges:

- **Non-linear dielectric measurements** affected by salinity and temperature
- **Non-monotonic behavior** requiring frequent calibration
- **Flow pattern dependency** limiting operational envelope
- **Limited accuracy** across full operating ranges

## Revolutionary AI-Based Solution

### Digital Twin Innovation
Our **completely new approach** tackles non-linear and non-monotonic behavior through:

#### ðŸ¤– **AI-Powered Digital Twin Model**
- Fully parametrized model outputs
- Non-linear dielectric response prediction
- Real-time adaptation capabilities

#### ðŸ“Š **Full Operating Range**
- **Water Cut (WC)**: 0-100%
- **Gas Volume Fraction (GVF)**: 0-95%
- **Salinity**: 0-250,000 ppm
- **Temperature**: -40Â°C to 125Â°C

### Industrial Validation
The model has been **validated through industrial-grade flow loop measurements** with comprehensive comparison studies.
