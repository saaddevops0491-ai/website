**Industrial flow loops play a critical role** in validating the performance of multiphase meters and it is considered an **essential benchmarking test** before rolling out the meters to the fields.

## World-Class Testing Facility

For the same reasons, **Saher Flow Solutions has proudly completed a flow loop test** at **South West Research Institute (SwRI)** located in San Antonio, TX, USA.

### Advanced Flow Loop Capabilities

**SwRI flow loop can generate a wide range of flow regimes** including:

- üåä **Stratified flow**
- „Ä∞Ô∏è **Wavy stratified flow**
- ü´ß **Bubbly flow**
- üêå **Slug flow**

## Realistic Test Conditions

### Authentic Gas Phase
SwRI makes use of **methane as a gaseous phase** which represents a **more realistic test condition** as compared to nitrogen gas commonly used in other flow loops.

### High-Pressure Testing
Moreover, the SwRI flow loop enables testing at **high-pressure levels up to 3,600 psi** to represent more realistic field conditions.

### Precise Environmental Control
In addition, **temperature and salinity conditions** are also precisely controlled to make accurate calibration possible. This is especially important for **microwave-based multiphase meters** as dielectric properties are a strong function of temperature and salinity.

## Revolutionary DMOR Technology

However, owing to the use of innovative **Dual Mutually Orthogonal Resonance technology (DMOR)**, Saher Flow offers **one of its kind microwave-based multiphase meter** which is **unaffected by varying salinity and temperature conditions** over a wide range of operating conditions.

## Overcoming Technical Challenges

### Complex Physics
Owing to the **non-linear & non-monotonic effect** of temperature and salinity on dielectric properties of the multiphase mixture, it is considered **almost impossible to detect both water-cut (WC) as well as gas volume fraction (GVF)** using just microwaves.

### AI-Powered Solution
However, **Saher Flow has successfully integrated the smart Digital Twin Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm** with the microwave sensors which enables multiphase sensing possible ‚Äì **without using any radioactive source or moving parts**.

## Key Technology Benefits

- ‚úÖ **No radioactive sources** - Safe for personnel and environment
- ‚úÖ **No moving parts** - Reduced maintenance and higher reliability
- ‚úÖ **AI-powered accuracy** - Digital Twin algorithm for precise measurements
- ‚úÖ **Wide operating range** - Unaffected by temperature and salinity variations
- ‚úÖ **Realistic testing** - Validated under actual field conditions
